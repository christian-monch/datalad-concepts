title: Schema for a generic data provenance annotation
description: |
  This schema builds on the [Thing schema](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/thing), and diversifies it to capture the key provenance concepts `Agent`, `Activity`, `Entity` and their relationships.
  It does that by drawing on (a subset) of the PROV data model [PROV-DM](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm).

  Central paradigm of the schema is the [qualified relation pattern](https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html).
  The three `Thing` derived key concepts `Agent`, `Activity`, and `Entity` build on the `Thing` slot `relation` (symmetric property) for **inline declaration** of related things, and extend the basic means of qualifying a relationship via `is_characterized_by` with provenance specific slots and corresponding association classes. For example:
 
  - `qualified_relations`: for an `EntityInfluence` on an `Entity`
  - `qualified_association`: for an `AgentInfluence` on an `Activity`
  - `qualified_attribution`: for an `AgentInfluence` on an `Entity`

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
