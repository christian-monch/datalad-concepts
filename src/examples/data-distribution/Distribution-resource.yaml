# Link a distribution to the resource it is representing, and the
# (versioned) data collections it is part of.
# The identifiers are arbitrary, but symbolize the distribution
# to be a format-specific materialization of a general resource
#
# The resource record is not inlined at `is_distribution_of`,
# because this avoids duplication in cases where multiple distributions
# of the same resource exist. The resource object only has to be
# defined once in a `relation` property
