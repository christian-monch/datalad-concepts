# Describe parts of a distribution
# The identifiers are arbitrary, but symbolize the nesting
# of a distribution in another.
# Alternatively, content-based identifiers can be used. They
# Enable lean documents, because parts can be referenced
# across different locations and versions after a single
# inline definition.
