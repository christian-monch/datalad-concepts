title: Concepts for ascribing provenance to entities
description: >-
  Provided components are centered around the annotation of provenance of
  entities, following the [W3C PROV data model](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm),
  and using the [W3C PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o).

  # Commit was_generated_by CommitActivity
  was_generated_by:
    slot_uri: prov:wasGeneratedBy
    description: >-
      A generation is the completion of production of a new entity by an
      activity. This entity did not exist before generation and becomes
      available for usage after this generation.
    domain: Entity
    range: Activity

  # Commit was_derived_from Commit
  was_derived_from:
    slot_uri: prov:wasDerivedFrom
    description: >-
      A derivation is a transformation of an entity into another, an update
      of an entity resulting in a new one, or the construction of a new
      entity based on a pre-existing entity.
    domain: Entity
    range: Entity

  # Commit was_attributed_to Author
  was_attributed_to:
    slot_uri: prov:wasAttributedTo
    description: >-
      Attribution is the ascribing of an entity to an agent.
    domain: Entity
    range: Agent

  # Commit was_associated_with Committer
  was_associated_with:
    slot_uri: prov:wasAssociatedWith
    description: >-
      An activity association is an assignment of responsibility to an agent
      for an activity, indicating that the agent had a role in the activity.
      It further allows for a plan to be specified, which is the plan intended
      by the agent to achieve some goals in the context of this activity.
    domain: Activity
    range: Agent

  was_informed_by:
    slot_uri: prov:wasInformedBy
    description: >-
      Communication is the exchange of an entity by two activities, one activity
      using the entity generated by the other.
    domain: Activity
    range: Activity

  # CommitActivity ended_at DateTime
  ended_at:
    slot_uri: prov:endedAtTime
    description: >-
      End is when an activity is deemed to have been ended by an entity,
      known as trigger. The activity no longer exists after its end.
      Any usage, generation, or invalidation involving an activity
      precedes the activity's end.
    domain: Activity
    range: string
    todos:
      - the `range` should be `datetime`. However, due to a bug in linkml such a declaration would break validation https://github.com/linkml/linkml/issues/1806

  # Commit generated_at DateTime (committer time)
  generated_at:
    slot_uri: prov:generatedAtTime
    description: >-
      (Date and) time at which the generation of an entity took place or was
      completed.
    domain: Entity
    range: datetime

  # Commit was_revision_of Dataset(unversioned concept)
  was_revision_of:
    slot_uri: prov:wasRevisionOf 
    description: >-
      A revision is a derivation for which the resulting entity is a revised
      version of some original. The implication here is that the resulting
      entity contains substantial content from the original. Revision is a
      particular case of derivation.
    domain: Entity
    range: Entity

  # DataladRun acted_on_behalf_of Author
  acted_on_behalf_of:
    slot_uri: prov:actedOnBehalfOf
    description: >-
      Delegation is the assignment of authority and responsibility to an
      agent (by itself or by another agent) to carry out a specific activity
      as a delegate or representative, while the agent it acts on behalf of
      retains some responsibility for the outcome of the delegated work.
    domain: Agent
    range: Agent

  at_location:
    slot_uri: prov:atLocation
    description: >-
      A location can be an identifiable geographic place (ISO 19112),
      but it can also be a non-geographic place such as a directory,
      row, or column. As such, there are numerous ways in which
      location can be expressed, such as by a coordinate, address,
      landmark, and so forth.

    mixin: true
    class_uri: prov:Activity
    description: >-

      transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.

  Agent:
