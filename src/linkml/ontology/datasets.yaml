title: Concepts for describing datasets
description: >
  Provided components are modeled after the DCAT v3 vocabulary
  (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3). Within the DataLad concepts ontology
  it provides the basic framework to describe multi-version, multi-component,
  distributed data. For this purpose, a notable difference from DCAT v3
  exist. 1) Resources other than datasets can have a distribution. A key
  resource with a distribution is a file. A corresponding class has been
  added (together with a directory class). 2) A "qualified relationship"
  pattern has been applied to the `hasPart` relationship, in order to be
  able to describe the particular composition of multi-component datasets
  (from referenceable component definitions). 3) Another
  "qualified relationship" pattern has been applied to the `access_service`
  property in order to be able to specify a (deviating) resource
  identifier for requesting a particular resource from a `DataService`.

    comments:
      - This class is a key element of the data model. It enables referencing
        a particular resource (e.g., a file's content, or versioned directory
        tree in multiple contexts, such as different versions of a dataset).

  File:
    mixin: true
    is_a: Resource
    description: >-
      Resource for storing information, which is available to a computer
      program and is usually based on some kind of durable storage.
      A file is a conceptual entity, and can be represented by one or more
      distributions that serialize the file for transfer. Distributions of
      a file can be provided via data services.
    slots:
      - distribution
    exact_mappings:
      - afo:AFR_0000639
    comments:
      - Being a conceptual entity, this class does not include properties
        for exact identification of a file's content. This is the domain
        of a `Distribution`.
      - It would make sense to avoid assigning a global identifier to an
        instance of this class and instead specify inline within its
        immediate context (e.g., a `QualifiedPart` of another `Resource`).

  Dataset:
    mixin: true
    is_a: Resource
    description: >-
      A collection of data, published or curated,
      and available for access or download in one or more
      representations. A dataset is a conceptual entity, and can be
      represented by one or more distributions that serialize the dataset
      for transfer. Distributions of a dataset can be provided via data
      services.

  Distribution:
    mixin: true
    description: >-
      A specific representation of a dataset (part). Such a resource
      might be available in multiple serializations.
    close_mappings:
      - DCAT:Distribution
    slots:
      - access_service
      - byte_size
      - checksum
      - qualified_access
    comments:
      - >-
        Compared to `DCAT:Distribution` this class has a `qualified_access`
        property to enable the specification of access-related parameters
        that cannot be inferred from a standard `DCAT:Distribution`.
    todos:
      - Now that there is a `Directory` subclass, re-evaluate the utility
        of the `checksum` property at this level.

  FilesystemDirectory:
    mixin: true
    is_a: Distribution
    description: >-
       Filesystem structure which contains references to files,
       or other directories.

  FilesystemDirectoryItem:
    mixin: true
    description: >-
       Named reference of a content item in the context of a `FilesystemDirectory`
    slots:
      - name

    todos:
      - Possibly factor out a dedicated `Item` class and derive from it.

  DataService:
