      An identifier that is encoded in a string.  This is used to represent
      identifiers that are not URIs, but are encoded as strings.  For example,
      a person's social security number is an encoded identifier.

      - The validation regex is taken from https://stackoverflow.com/a/201378
      - The regex is single-quoted for YAML encoding, hence all inner "'" have been doubled

      Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). 128-bit label that is, for
      practical purposes, unique. Its uniqueness does not depend on a
      central registration authority or coordination between the parties
      generating them. Information labeled with UUIDs by independent
      parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or
      transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of
      duplication.
