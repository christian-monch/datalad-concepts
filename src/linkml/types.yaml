    description: >-
      Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). 128-bit label that is, for
      practical purposes, unique. Its uniqueness does not depend on a
      central registration authority or coordination between the parties
      generating them. Information labeled with UUIDs by independent
      parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or
      transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of
      duplication.
